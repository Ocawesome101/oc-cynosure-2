CYX: the CYnosure eXecutable
============================

Numbers are little-endian.

4 bytes: magic number 0x43796e6f
1 byte: executable version (this document describes version 0)
1 byte: flags:
  0x1   | lua 5.3 only
  0x2   | static linked (libraries bundled)?
  0x4   | is bootable image
  0x8   | is executable
  0x10  | is library
  0x20  | big-endian (otherwise little-endian)
  0x40  | has no interpreter
  0x80  | code is lzss-compressed
1 byte: OS ID:
  0   | Cynosure 2.0
  1   | OpenOS
  2   | Tsuki
  3   | Fuchas
  4   | MiniOS NT
  5   | PsychOS
  6   | Linux
  7   | macOS
  8   | Windows
  255 | N/A
1 byte: number of links
for each link:
  1 byte: length of library name
  N bytes: library name
  In the case of static linking, libraries should
  be copied into the data section at link time.
  
  Otherwise, the first linked library must be an
  absolute path to an interpreter (e.g.
  /lib/ld-cyx.so).  Note that this requirement is
  currently only enforced under Cynosure 2, but is
  good practice and should at least be supported
  by CYX loaders.

N bytes: data


The CYX interpreter under Cynosure 2.0 must take a file descriptor as its first argument.  This file descriptor is to be used to read the executable file data, and closed.
