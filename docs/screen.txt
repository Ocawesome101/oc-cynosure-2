// Screens: the powerful abstraction

One of the core features of Cynosure 2's portability scheme is the concept of a generic "screen" object.  This enables easy portability to new platforms.  Place your platform's `screen' implementation in `src/platform/PLATFORM/screen.lua'.

A screen must have the following methods:

  setPalette(colors): Sets the screen's palette colors.  The `colors' table is 1-indexed;  this must be accounted for when setting 0-based palette indices.

  scroll(n, top, bot): Scroll the screen, with an optional top and bottom line

  set(x, y, text): Write the specified text at the specified coordinates.  Must not wrap.

  copy(x, y, w, h, xoff, yoff): Copy the specified region to `x + xoff', `y + yoff'.  Identical to OpenComputers' `gpu.copy'.

  fill(x, y, w, h, c): Fill the specified area with character `c'.

  setForeground(rgb): Set the terminal foreground to `rgb'.  If only a fixed palette is supported, approximate with the nearest color in the palette.
  
  setBackground(rgb): Set te terminal background to `rgb'.
  
  get(x, y) -> c, fg, bg: Retrieve the character at (x, y), plus its foreground and background colors
