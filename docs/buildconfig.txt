Cynosure 2 Build Configuration
------------------------------

This file describes the options available for Cynosure 2's build configuration file (.buildconfig in the main source tree).

KNAME=NAME
  where NAME is to be appended to the kernel version string.  (default "default")

KPLATFORM=PLAT
  where PLAT is any supported platform.  Currently:
    - 'oc' for OpenComputers (default)
    - 'cc' for ComputerCraft

KEYMAP=MAP
  where MAP is the name of one of the keymaps in src/keymaps.  Currently:
    - lwjgl2 (default, for running in Minecraft 1.12.2 (including OpenComputers) or CraftOS-PC)
    - lwjgl3 (for ComputerCraft running on Minecraft 1.13+)

PREEMPT=MODE
  where MODE is the preemption mode to use.  Currently:
    - few (default, less responsive when programs are consuming lots of CPU time)
    - many (more forced yields, possibly slower system)

  append 'hook' to the chosen option to use debug.sethook for rather than yield injection (ComputerCraft only)

KINCLUDE_TMPFS=[yn]
  to specify if the tmpfs (usually mounted at /tmp) should be supported.  (default y)

KUSE_SOFTWARE_TMPFS=[yn]
  to use a software tmpfs rather than the hardware one (only set to 'n' under OpenComputers) (default y)

KINCLUDE_DEVFS=[yn]
  to specify if the devfs (usually mounted at /dev) should be included.  (default y)

KINCLUDE_SYSFS=[yn]
  to specify if the sysfs (usually mounted at /sys) should be included in the kernel.  (default y)

BUILTIN_TTY=[yn]
  to specify whether to include the built-in vt100 emulator (say 'n' if you're running an embedded or graphical-only system) (default y)

BUILTIN_EXECS=LIST
  where LIST is a comma-delimited list of the executable formats to build in.  Currently:
    - cyx (the CYnosure eXecutable format, highly recommended) (default)

BUILTIN_FILESYSTEMS=LIST
  where LIST is a comma-delimited list of the filesytem drivers to include.  Currently:
    - managed (managed filesystems with special extensions) (default)

IO_BUFSIZE=SIZE
  where SIZE is the size to use for the kernel's internal file stream buffering.  (default 512)

MANAGED_BLOCKSIZE=SIZE
  where SIZE is the maximum chunk size for reading from a managed file handle.  Overridden by the kernel argument fs.managed.blocksize=SIZE.  For optimal performance under OpenComputers this value should match the value in your Minecraft server's configuration.  Only affects OpenComputers.  (default 2048)
