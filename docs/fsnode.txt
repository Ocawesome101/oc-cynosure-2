FSNode: Cynosure VFS Nodes
==========================

This document describes the functions required of a Cynosure-compatible filesystem node object and the behavior of those functions.

See `docs/filemodes.txt` for details on the `mode` argument that some functions accept.

node:open(file:string, flags:table[, mode:number]): fd:number
  This function shall open the specified `file` in accordance with the specified `flags`.  It shall return a numeric file descriptor, which does not have to be unique except to the filesystem node to which it belongs.

node:read(fd:number, count:number): read:string
  This function shall, if the specified `fd` is a valid file descriptor, read `count` bytes from the file to which that descriptor points.  Otherwise, it shall return `nil` and the value specified in `k.errno.EBADF`.
