# Contributing

If you wish to contribute to Cynosure, please adhere to the following formatting guidelines:

No lines of code longer than 80 characters.

Indent your code with 2 spaces. Please don't use tabs.

If creating a new kernel source file, base it on `src/template.lua` so you get the copyright notice and whatnot.

If modifying an existing source file, add your name to the list at the top of the file.

Functions, particularly functions likely to be used elsewhere, should preferably be annotated with EmmyLua-style annotations.

Code should be reasonably commented and easy to understand; if it is not, an explanation is warranted.
