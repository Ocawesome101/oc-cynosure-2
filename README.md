# Cynosure 2.0

This is the second major version of Cynosure.  Much of it has been rewritten, providing a more POSIX-like experience all around.  However, it maintains the same goals of stability, completeness, and reasonable speed.

Cynosure 2.0 is not designed to be lightweight on memory.

Build by running `scripts/build.lua` from the repository root.  Run `scripts/genuptconf.lua` before attempting to build a UPT package.
